# HA Desktop Widget v2.3.6 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 21, 2025

## 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements

- **Setup Controls Restored:** The Settings, Minimize, and Close buttons now respond correctly on the initial "Setup Required" screen, making first-time configuration frictionless.
- **Tray-Friendly Minimize:** Minimizing the widget hides it to the system tray reliably, and clicking the tray icon toggles the window back into view.
- **Consistent Branding:** Updated tray icon logic to reuse the packaged desktop icon (with new `build/icon.png` / `icon.ico` assets) so the tray matches the app’s branding in both dev and packaged builds.

## 📦 Assets
- Updated `build/icon.png` and `build/icon.ico` are bundled for electron-builder packaging.

## 🔄 Upgrade Notes
- No action required—just install v2.3.6 and enjoy the restored controls and improved tray behavior.
